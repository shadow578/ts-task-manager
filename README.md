# Task Manager
This repo contains a simple but bad task manager application written in typescript using electron, react and mui.
It isn't really practical to use this for anything other than a learning experience.


## Why is this so bad?
To be honest, this is only meant as a demo for the `@shadow578/powershell-binding` package, which allows you to use powershell in nodejs.
But that package is more targeted at doing things like ad management (think `Get-AdUser` and `Set-AdUser`).

This demo however attemts to display processes in real-time using `Get-Process`, which does not really work for performance reasons (refresh takes like 10 seconds).
But nevertheless, this is a functional demo.


## How to run

1. Don't
2. Clone the Repo
3. Install Dependencies using `npm install`
4. Run using `npm start`
